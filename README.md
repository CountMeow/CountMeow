Name: Calx
Age: 21
Currently majoring in Programming 
I'm in my final year there! 

I work in the EVS department at Crystal Clinic and want to eventually move up into medical software when I graduate.
Medical Software or perhaps something with video games if I'm lucky enough. I also have an IT Internship with the Computer Center on Akron's Campus. 

Programming Languages:
Currently Know:

Projects:
I mostly build smallish projects in Python with the knowledge I have. My biggest project is a major collab in class with 3 classmates to produce a fully running program of Blackjack with a maintaining bet system.
On my own, I've been trying to produce my own game called Cat Warriors, where you play as a cat and fight enemies.
