I mostly build smallish projects in Python with the knowledge I have. My biggest project is a major collab in class with 3 classmates to produce a fully running program of Blackjack with a maintaining bet system.
On my own, I've been trying to produce my own game called Cat Warriors, where you play as a cat and fight enemies.
